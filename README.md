This is a web application that will identify a job posting as real or fake based on certain criteria and information, using NLP and Machine Learning Classification models. 
If the job posting ends up being real, the web application will ask the user to upload their resume in PDF format. 
Using Large Language Models (LLMs) the application will create a Cover Letter using the PDF and the job description.
